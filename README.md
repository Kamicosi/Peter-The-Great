My personal Discord bot, created in 2020 for me and friends. This was worked on over quarantine until I got bored and stopped development in mid summer 2020.

The main feature of this bot is the ability to download vidoes from YouTube, SoundCloud, and a few other websites and stream the audio into a voice channel in our Discord server so that my friends and I could listen to music together. There are also options to create playlists and maintain a queue of songs.
Other things this bot can do include scraping Wikipedia based on a search term and returning a summary of the resulting article, sending a random meme in the text channel, and an RPG system where users had a chance to randomly find an item upon every message sent and could then use these items to battle other users to gain money and level up.

Warning: this code contains some mild juvenile humor in some places.
